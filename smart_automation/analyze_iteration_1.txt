Please provide specific code changes in this format:

For src/main.rs:
1. Replace "old code" with "new code"
2. Change variable_name = old_value to new_value
3. Add "new code" after "existing code"

Focus on:
- Text positioning accuracy
- Font sizes and styles
- Layout preservation
- Form field rendering
- Table structure

Be very specific with exact code snippets that can be automatically applied.
